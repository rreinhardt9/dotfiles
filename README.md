# My Dotfiles

Because of the .vim submodules, don't forget to clone using `git clone --recursive repo` to get all of the submodules as well.

Once you've cloned it, just make some some symlink (be sure to use full paths) `ln -s dotfilesource linkedfile`

- Import Solarized.terminal into your terminal profiles and make it the default using the terminal preferences menu. This will make the solarized profile in vim look way better.
- I use FiraCode font from [the fira code repo](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
- Use brew to install the silver searcher `brew install the_silver_searcher`
