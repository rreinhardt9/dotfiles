# R Language - Unmaintained

:rotating_light: This package is no longer maintained. See the [Updates section](#updates) for details. :rotating_light:

A language package for [R](http://www.r-project.org).

Originally imported from [r.tmbundle](https://github.com/textmate/r.tmbundle).

## Updates

I no longer use R in my daily work and haven't for a couple years. I also no longer have the time to maintain this package properly. If anyone is interested in taking over the maintenance of this package and eventually the repository, please post an [Issue](https://github.com/lee-dohm/language-r/issues/new) with the subject of "Volunteer Maintainer". Other Issues and PRs will be closed.
