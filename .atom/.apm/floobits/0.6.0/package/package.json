Think Etherpad, but with native editors. This is the plugin for Atom. We also have plugins for [Sublime Text](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-sublime), [Emacs](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-emacs), [Vim](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-vim), and [IntelliJ](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-intellij).\n\n### Development status: alpha under heavy development\nDocumentation is lacking, but you could probably get by using the sublime text docs.\n\n# Configuration\n\nA floobits account is required.  If you don't have one, the plugin will guide you through the process.\n\n# Help\n\nIf you have trouble setting up or using this plugin, please [contact us](https://floobits.com/help#support).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-atom/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-atom","_id":"floobits@0.6.0","_shasum":"d556a90b4b1857d56a09a547c871af536728d7de","_resolved":"file:../d-115713-49776-1mzypef/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115713-49776-1mzypef/package.tgz"}
